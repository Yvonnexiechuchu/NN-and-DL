Neural Network and Deep Learning Concepts

This workshop will introduce the core concepts of neural networks to solve business problems, especially including modern techniques for deep learning.  We will use Googleâ€™s Tensor Flow to solve a deep learning problem.
Concepts explained include: 
1. Neural Network
2. Gradient descent and back propagation
3. Activation functions
4. Deep Neural Network: Convoluted Neural Network
5. Example using TensorFlow
